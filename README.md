### AI based research-paper recommendation with E-mail services üìöü¶æ

PaperGo is an innovative research paper recommendation system that leverages artificial intelligence to provide personalized recommendations to researchers and scholars. With its powerful algorithms and integration of email services, PaperGo aims to streamline the process of discovering relevant research papers and keeping users updated with the latest findings in their field.

## Key features üîç-

- Advanced Recommendation Algorithms: PaperGo employs a combination of TF-IDF and KNN-like algorithms to cluster research papers based on their content and similarity. This ensures accurate and tailored recommendations to suit each user's interests.

- Custom Dataset: PaperGo's dataset is meticulously curated by scraping research papers from the IEEE website. This guarantees a vast collection of high-quality academic papers across various domains.

- User-Friendly Front End: The front end of PaperGo is built using React, providing a seamless and intuitive user experience. The integration of Google Authentication ensures secure access to the platform. Web-app is completely responsive and can be used for any type of screen.

- AWS Simple Email Services: PaperGo leverages the power of AWS SES to deliver periodic research paper recommendations directly to users' email inboxes. This ensures that users stay informed about the latest developments in their field without any hassle.

- Express.js and Flask Integration: PaperGo is powered by Express.js on the backend, providing a robust and scalable infrastructure for efficient data processing and recommendation generation. Flask, a Python web framework, is also utilized to handle specific functionalities seamlessly.
